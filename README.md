# *Small-to-Medium Azure Virtual Desktop Home Lab Project*

**Landing Zone**
Before deploying any resources, I took time to plan out the overall structure of the environment by creating an architecture diagram. This helped visualize the components involved in the AVD setup, how they would interact, and ensured a clear understanding of network flows, identity integration, and FSLogix configuration. While the lab was deployed manually, the diagram acted as a blueprint that guided each step of the process.

**Technologies used**
- 365 Admin Center
  -  Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Entra ID
- Azure Portal
- Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)
- FSLogix Profile Containers
- Azure Storage/Files (Premium File Share)
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- Windows 10/11 Multi-Session Host (AVD Optimized Image)


This is a manually deployed Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment built from scratch using the Azure portal. The goal was to gain deep, hands-on experience with the core components and configuration process of AVD. 

The project also incorporates key enterprise concepts like Conditional Access, FSLogix profile containers, Entra ID integration, Networking, Image configuration and RemoteApp delivery. During the process of implementation I have picked up knowledge of its architecture and use cases through exposure in my current role.
