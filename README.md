This is a manually deployed Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment built from scratch using the Azure portal. The goal was to gain deep, hands-on experience with the core components and configuration process of AVD. 

The project also incorporates key enterprise concepts like Conditional Access, FSLogix profile containers, Entra ID integration, Networking, Image configuration and RemoteApp delivery. During the process of implementation I have picked up knowledge of its architecture and use cases through exposure in my current role.
